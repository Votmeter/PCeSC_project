1) Tool to select a trajectory among the already existing ones. The selected
    element will be displayed in the page and its metadata (name, dates,
    etc...) will accordingly show up.
2) Tool to take a trajectory (json) either in file form or in "text" form
3) Once the json format is parsed, the trajectory need to be visualized in the
    page
4) Each element (couple latitude-longitude) of the trajectory needs has to be 
    selectable and from there modifiable.
5) Once the process is done (either after the modification or after the
     upload), a save button needs to be made available. The pressing of the
     button makes the modifications permanent and updates the existing DB.
